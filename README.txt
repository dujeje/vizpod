# Interactive Data Visualization with D3.js - Israeli-Palestinian Conflict Fatality Trends

## Project Overview

Interactive data visualization project using D3.js. The focus is on the "Fatality Trends in the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict from 2000 to 2023," visualizing the annual fatalities in a comprehensive and interactive manner.

## Data Source

The dataset visualizes the number of Israeli and Palestinian victims in the conflict over the years 2000 to 2023.

## Visualization Structures

The project features two main interactive visual structures:

- **Line Chart**: This displays the trend of fatalities over the years. Users can select a specific year to view detailed statistics.
- **Pie Chart**: Upon selecting a year on the line chart, the pie chart updates to show the proportion of Israeli and Palestinian victims for that year.

These structures allow for an interactive exploration of the data, offering insights into the annual changes in fatality trends.
